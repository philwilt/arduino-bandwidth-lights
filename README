Edit settings for your port, baud rate, and factor to scale by in bandwidthMon.c.

I use a scale of 500 for bandwidth values between 0 and 50 MBps, with 50Mbps being max.

Edit pin settings for your arduino in main.cpp and upload to your arduino.

Compile bandwidthMon.c, execute and enjoy.



TODO:

Enter port, baud rate, delay, and scale factor from the command line.

Python version to be added soon for comparison.
